# Snake-AI: An Intelligent Snake Game
## Introduction
Welcome to Snake-AI, an enhanced version of the classic Snake game, which allows not only human players to enjoy the game but also includes an AI that can play the game using various graph algorithms. This project aims to showcase the implementation of a perfect game using a Hamiltonian cycle and compare its performance with other algorithms like Dijkstra, BFS, and DFS for fun and performance analysis purposes

## Features
- Classic Gameplay: Enjoy the timeless classic snake game with a modern twist.
- Snake-AI: A highly performant AI that plays a perfect game of snake using a Hamiltonian cycle.
- Interactive Interface: A user-friendly interface created using Pygame to visualize the game and track both human and AI performances.
- Multiple AI Algorithms: Includes various AI algorithms such as Dijkstra, BFS, and Hamiltonian Cycle to demonstrate different approaches to the game.
- Comparative Scoring System: A built-in system to track and compare the performance of different AI algorithms, providing a comprehensive educational tool.

## Installation

### Running from Source

To run Snake-AI on your local machine, follow these steps:

- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies, primarily Pygame, by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
- Navigate to the source directory and run python main.py to start the game.

### Downloading the Executable

For a quick start, you can download the pre-built executable from the releases section of the GitHub repository:

- Look for the [latest release](https://github.com/HansYolo43/Snake/releases) and download the executable file (main.exe).
- Run the downloaded file to start playing immediately without needing to install any additional dependencies.
  

## How to Play
- For Human Players: Use arrow keys to navigate the snake around the screen, collecting food and avoiding collisions.
- For AI Mode: Choose the AI algorithm you wish to observe from the main menu. The game will automatically start, and you can watch the AI play.
